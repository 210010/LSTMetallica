 * Please check out my [blot post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/lstmetallica/) for more information.
 * [This playlist](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstmetallica-drums) or and [this](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/00-24-100-bonus-for-score) are the generated drum tracks on soundcloud.
 * Also there's my another similar work on jazz chord progression [repository](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/lstm_real_book/blob/master/README.md), [blog post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/lstm-realbook/), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstm-realbook-1-5)
